### Hi there!

I am a third-year PhD student in Political Science at the University of Maryland. My research focuses on the intricacies of electoral design, party competition, and electoral outcomes. I am also developing a keen interest in understanding patterns of judicial behavior, using causal inference and natural language processing to identify how judges reason, signal, and justify decisions in constitutional and electoral disputes. My work has been published in *Scientific Data*, *Electoral Studies*, and *Asian Journal of Comparative Politics*, as well as in edited volumes by *Routledge* and *Palgrave Macmillan*. 

Before starting graduate school, I spent over five years working as a researcher at the Jakarta-based think tank, the [Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)](https://www.csis.or.id), where I remain affiliated. 

I take caffeine seriously and believe in the endogenous impact of coffee on graduate school success. I’m also a bedroom amateur guitar player who enjoys spending evenings trying to improve my mediocre skills (one riff at a time).
