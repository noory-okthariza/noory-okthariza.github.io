My research focuses on the intersection of political behavior and development, with an emphasis on how institutions and historical legacies shape political and economic outcomes in Southeast Asia. I combine causal inference and machine learning with a deep understanding of regional contexts to explore these dynamics. Before starting graduate school, I spent over five years working as a researcher at the Jakarta-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Indonesia.\nI take caffeine seriously and believe in the endogenous impact of coffee on graduate school success. I dedicate as much time to perfecting espresso-making as I do to coding.\n\n\n\nContact\nDepartment of Government & Politics\nUniversity of Maryland\n3140 Tydings Hall\nCollege Park, MD 20742\n✉️ noory@umd.edu"
