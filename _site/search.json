My research focuses on the intricacies of electoral design, party competition, and electoral outcomes. I am also developing a keen interest in understanding patterns of judicial behavior, using causal inference and natural language processing to identify how judges reason, signal, and justify decisions in constitutional and electoral disputes. My work has been published in Scientific Data, Electoral Studies, and Asian Journal of Comparative Politics, as well as in edited volumes by Routledge and Palgrave Macmillan.\nBefore starting graduate school, I spent over five years working as a researcher at the Jakarta-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where I remain affiliated.\nI take caffeine seriously and believe in the endogenous impact of coffee on graduate school success. I’m also a bedroom amateur guitarist who enjoys spending evenings trying to improve my mediocre skills (one riff at a time).\n\n\n\nContact\nDepartment of Government & Politics\nUniversity of Maryland\n3140 Tydings Hall\nCollege Park, MD 20742\n✉️ noory@umd.edu"
