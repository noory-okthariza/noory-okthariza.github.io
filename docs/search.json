My research focuses on the intricacies of electoral design, party competition, and electoral outcomes. I am also developing a keen interest in understanding patterns of judicial behavior, using causal inference and natural language processing to identify how judges reason, signal, and justify decisions in constitutional and electoral disputes. My work has been published in Scientific Data, Electoral Studies, and Asian Journal of Comparative Politics, as well as in edited volumes by Routledge and Palgrave Macmillan.\nBefore starting graduate school, I spent over five years working as a researcher at the Jakarta-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where I remain affiliated.\nI take caffeine seriously and believe in the endogenous impact of coffee on graduate school success. I’m also a bedroom amateur guitar playerr who enjoys spending evenings trying to improve my mediocre skills (one riff at a time).\n\n\n\nContact\nDepartment of Government & Politics\nUniversity of Maryland\n3140 Tydings Hall\nCollege Park, MD 20742\n✉️ noory@umd.edu"

    "text": "My advisor, our collaborators, and have been involved in an ongoing effort to compile fine-grained electoral data in Indonesia. The goal is to provide researchers and Indonesian observers with a one-stop, comprehensive resource on Indonesia’s elections. We also work with the election tribunal (KPU) to supplement the datasets we need. So far, we have collected data from 2014 to 2024, and earlier election data will soon be updated as well. Parts of the descriptive analysis of these data have been published in Scientific Data. You can look at the data source here. And here is the abstract of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\nThis paper introduces an Indonesian Election Archive built by a team of scholars and democratic NGO practitioners from Indonesia and the United States. This archive aims to address the calls of international democracy advocates by providing systematic, longitudinal election data across multiple levels of elected administration in Indonesia. We document the efforts of a leading civil society group, the Association for Elections and Democracy (Perludem), and its collaboration with the Indonesian Electoral Commission (KPU) to supply voters with information before and after elections. The archive provides a collection of the laws governing elections to the Presidency and Vice Presidency, the Lower House of the National Legislature (DPR), the Upper House (DPD), regional legislatures and local heads from 1999 to 2024. Additionally, we provide candidate data and election results for the three most recent elections (2014, 2019, and 2024) covering the offices of the Presidency and Vice-Presidency, and both Houses."
